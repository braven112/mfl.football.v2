## 💡 Key Features

### No API Keys Required

- Manual override via query string
- Logo files for all major networks

### Developer Friendly
- Simple npm scripts
- Clear documentation
- Example outputs

## 📈 Performance

### API Calls
- **ESPN**: 1 call per week
- **NWS**: ~24 calls for typical week (2 per outdoor game)
- **Total time**: ~10 seconds with rate limiting

### Caching
- Data cached locally in JSON files
- No API calls during page build
- Re-run scripts to refresh data

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

Potential additions (not yet implemented):
- [ ] Weather alerts for severe conditions (snow, wind, rain)
- [ ] Historical weather accuracy tracking
- [ ] Wind speed and direction
- [ ] Precipitation probability
- [ ] Impact analysis (e.g., "High winds may affect passing game")

## 📝 Notes

### Timing
- Run weather enrichment closer to game day for accuracy
- NWS provides forecasts up to 7 days out
- Indoor venues don't need weather updates

### Maintenance
- New stadiums: Add coordinates to `STADIUM_COORDS`
- New countries: Update `broadcast-mappings.json`
- New networks: Add logos to `public/assets/tv-logos/`

### Testing
- Use query string `?country=CA` or `?country=AU`
- Check browser timezone detection
- Verify logo files exist for all channels

## ✨ Success Metrics
