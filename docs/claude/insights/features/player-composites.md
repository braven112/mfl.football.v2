# Player Composite Imagery

## Context

Approved photo direction for the whole site (2026-07-04): identifiable NFL action
photography is rights-managed (Getty/AP/Imagn), so player imagery is built as
**CSS composites over free ESPN CDN headshots** — transparent PNGs layered on
team-color gradients with ghost typography. No licensed photos, fully automatic
per player.

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/components/shared/PlayerHeroComposite.astro` | The composite banner (gradient + ghost wordmark + glow + headshot + position chip) |
| `src/utils/nfl-team-colors.ts` | 32-team primary/secondary hex map (ESPN codes), nickname helper, `hexToRgba` |
| `src/components/shared/SchefterPostCard.astro` | First integration — breaking-tier feed posts |
| `scripts/schefter-scan.mjs` | Attaches `playerIds` on TRADE / AUCTION_WON / FREE_AGENT posts at generation time |

## Insights

- **Transparency is the load-bearing requirement.** ESPN headshots
  (`a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/{espnId}.png`) are transparent;
  the MFL fallback (`player_photos_big_2014/{id}_thumb.jpg`) has a baked-in
  background and ruins the composite. Gate rendering on
  `headshot.includes('espncdn.com')` — never composite an MFL JPG.
- **DEF "players" are logos, not people** — always exclude `position === 'DEF'`
  from composites.
- `getPlayerMap()` (src/utils/player-map.ts) is the one-stop resolver:
  MFL ID → name/position/nflTeam/espnId/headshot, cached per year. It reads
  theleague's players.json but MFL player IDs are global, so it resolves AFL
  posts' players too.
- **`playerIds[0]` is the featured player** — the feed card composites only the
  first ID. Trade posts order IDs received-side-first so `[0]` matches the
  headline player. If `[0]` is a DEF, the composite is skipped even when `[1]`
  is a star (accepted edge case).
- **Feed posts bake MFL "Last, First" display strings** into headline/body
  (e.g. "RB Pacheco, Isiah"). Historical backfill matched those exact strings
  against players.json — deterministic, no fuzzy matching. Older posts predate
  `tradeSignature`, so text matching is the only reliable route.
- **Breaking-tier only, on purpose.** Minor FA adds with hero banners would be
  noise; if everything is breaking news, nothing is.
- The composite hides itself on image 404 via inline
  `onerror="this.closest('.phc').style.display='none'"` — a gradient-only
  banner with no player reads as broken.
- The preview-panel screenshot tool returned gray frames on the deeply-scrolled
  SSR feed; Playwright against the dev server captured fine (same finding as
  the What's New screenshot workflow in CLAUDE.md).

## Future Directions (from the approved demo)

Three more styles were demoed and approved alongside the breaking card:
feature-article hero (jersey number as background texture), split matchup card
(mirrored headshots via `scaleX(-1)`), and compact spotlight card for
rankings/free-agent grids. All reuse `nfl-team-colors.ts` + the same headshot
gating rules.
