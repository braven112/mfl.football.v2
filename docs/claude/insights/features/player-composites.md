# Player Composite Imagery

## Context

Approved photo direction for the whole site (2026-07-04): identifiable NFL action
photography is rights-managed (Getty/AP/Imagn), so player imagery is built as
**CSS composites over free ESPN CDN headshots** — transparent PNGs layered on
team-color gradients with ghost typography. No licensed photos, fully automatic
per player.

## Key Files

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `src/components/shared/PlayerHeroComposite.astro` | The composite banner (gradient + ghost wordmark + glow + headshot + position chip) |
| `src/utils/nfl-team-colors.ts` | 32-team primary/secondary hex map (ESPN codes), nickname helper, `hexToRgba` |
| `src/components/shared/SchefterPostCard.astro` | First integration — breaking-tier feed posts |
| `scripts/schefter-scan.mjs` | Attaches `playerIds` on TRADE / AUCTION_WON / FREE_AGENT posts at generation time |

## Insights

- **Transparency is the load-bearing requirement.** ESPN headshots
  (`a.espncdn.com/i/headshots/nfl/players/full/{espnId}.png`) are transparent;
  the MFL fallback (`player_photos_big_2014/{id}_thumb.jpg`) has a baked-in
  background and ruins the composite. Gate rendering on
  `headshot.includes('espncdn.com')` — never composite an MFL JPG.
- **DEF "players" are logos, not people** — always exclude `position === 'DEF'`
  from composites.
- `getPlayerMap()` (src/utils/player-map.ts) is the one-stop resolver:
  MFL ID → name/position/nflTeam/espnId/headshot, cached per year. It reads
  theleague's players.json but MFL player IDs are global, so it resolves AFL
  posts' players too.
- **`playerIds[0]` is the featured player** — the feed card composites only the
  first ID. Trade posts order IDs received-side-first so `[0]` matches the
  headline player. If `[0]` is a DEF, the composite is skipped even when `[1]`
  is a star (accepted edge case).
- **Feed posts bake MFL "Last, First" display strings** into headline/body
  (e.g. "RB Pacheco, Isiah"). Historical backfill matched those exact strings
  against players.json — deterministic, no fuzzy matching. Older posts predate
  `tradeSignature`, so text matching is the only reliable route.
- **Breaking-tier only, on purpose.** Minor FA adds with hero banners would be
  noise; if everything is breaking news, nothing is.
- The composite hides itself on image 404 via inline
  `onerror="this.closest('.phc').style.display='none'"` — a gradient-only
  banner with no player reads as broken.
- The preview-panel screenshot tool returned gray frames on the deeply-scrolled
  SSR feed; Playwright against the dev server captured fine (same finding as
  the What's New screenshot workflow in CLAUDE.md).

## Casting Rules (Brandon, 2026-07-04 — binding)

- **New features / What's New heroes cast a ROOKIE** — rookies represent "new."
- **Roster-action heroes (tags, cuts, contracts) cast a player from the
  signed-in owner's team** (the suggested candidate); guests get a relevant
  player from someone's team.
- **Every hero casts a semantically relevant player** — the actual player in a
  breaking story, never a random star for decoration.
- All casting goes through `src/utils/hero-casting.ts` (`castRookieModel`,
  `castEnhancementModel`, `castRosterModel`) — deterministic per PT day
  (stable SSR, daily rotation). Rookie = newest draft class ≤ the reference
  year present in the player map (`PlayerIdentity.draftYear`, added for this).
- **Per What's New category** (Brandon, 2026-07-04): new-page/new-feature →
  rookie (rostered-first; unrostered only when NO rookie is rostered);
  enhancement → rostered player in his first 5 NFL seasons (strict, no
  unrostered fallback; caption "Nth Year"); bug-fix → no player, league logo
  silhouette (`.fch__logo-art`, light/dark asset pair); league-event →
  relevant player (event-hero conversions pending). Category rides on
  `HeroContent.heroCategory`; the roster set unions salary data with
  `getRosteredPlayerIds()` (MFL rosters feed) so dev matches prod.

## Shipped Use Cases

1. **Fresh What's New homepage hero (first shipped)** —
   `src/components/theleague/FeatureCompositeHero.astro`, rendered by
   `SeasonDailyHero` when `phase === 'offseason-fallback'` and
   `fallbackHero.source === 'feature'` and a rookie model was cast
   (index.astro passes `featureModel`; casting failure falls back to the
   branded LeagueEventHero). NOT integrated on the Schefter feed — Brandon
   explicitly rejected feed-card composites (built, then reverted).
   Gotcha: set explicit `color` on text over the composite gradient — global
   heading rules (and `html.dark` accent overrides) restyle bare headings.
   The hero is theme-aware (light gradient by default, dark under `html.dark`)
   via `--fch-*` CSS vars; a What's New entry can force the dark treatment in
   light mode with `"heroTheme": "dark"` (plumbed WhatsNewEntry → HeroContent
   via `featureToHero`) — used when the dark card IS the story, e.g. the
   dark-mode launch entry. Hero copy (title/summary/CTA/date) is bottom-left,
   vertically centered; the model is named in a frosted caption bottom-right.

2. **Auction hero (March P0 window)** —
   `src/components/theleague/AuctionCompositeHero.astro`, rendered for
   `auction-preview`/`auction-live` when `castTopFreeAgentModel` resolves
   (index.astro passes `auctionModel`; legacy `AuctionHero` is the fallback,
   so its `randomHeroPlayer` decoration only survives as a defensive path).
   Model = highest-ranked AVAILABLE free agent by dynasty ADP
   (`getAdpRankedIds` in offseason-hero-data), top-5 daily rotation.
   Keeps the command-center essentials as a chip row (bid CTA + 4 links)
   instead of the shell's side panel. Amber money accent, theme-aware.
   Gotcha: deep FAs can have an `espn_id` whose headshot PNG still 404s
   (e.g. Robert Henry) — `onerror` swaps in the league-logo silhouette via
   `.ach--no-model` instead of leaving an empty flank. Can't be detected
   server-side without a HEAD request; deliberately not done in the SSR
   hot path.
   **Live state (Brandon, 2026-07-05):** the league logo IS the background
   art (`.ach__backdrop`, replaces the ghost AUCTION wordmark; the 404
   logo-art fallback is suppressed via `.ach--live` so logos never stack),
   and the model switches to **the player whose bid clock runs out first**
   (`castClosingAuctionModel` — min `anchorTimestamp` + MFL's 36h rule,
   falls through non-compositable players). Caption gains a gold high-bid
   line ("$760K high bid · ~14h left"); summary names the leading
   franchise. `loadActiveAuctions` now also runs during auction phases.
   ADP best-available remains the fallback when no auctions are live.

3. **Cut watch hero (Jun 1 → 3rd Sun Aug)** —
   `src/components/theleague/CutWatchCompositeHero.astro`, rendered for the
   `cut-watch` phase when `castRosterModel` resolves a bubble player from
   `cutWatchProps.overLimitTeams[].cutCandidates` (index.astro passes
   `cutWatchModel`; legacy CutWatchHero panel version is the fallback).
   First real use of the personalization rule: the signed-in owner's own
   suggested cut candidate models the hero (their chip reads "You +N");
   guests get a league-wide candidate. Keeps both tiers (blue planning /
   red urgency via `.cwh--urgent`), the personalized summary, a 3-metric
   row (teams over / cuts required / biggest contract at risk), and
   over-limit team chips via `chooseTeamName(…, 'short')`. Same
   headshot-404 → logo-silhouette fallback as the auction hero.

4. **Preseason/kickoff hero (FA close → NFL kickoff)** —
   `src/components/theleague/PreseasonCompositeHero.astro`. Casting rule
   (Brandon): the best (highest-projected) player STARTING IN THE EARLIEST
   GAME of the week — the season opener; signed-in owners with a player in
   that game see their own best player in it ("Your Kickoff Starter").
   Deterministic best via `castBestScoredModel` (no daily rotation).
   Data: new `nflSchedule` MFL feed (league-agnostic, added to
   fetch-mfl-feeds.mjs — current week's games + kickoff timestamps);
   `getKickoffGame` / `getKickoffGameCandidates` in offseason-hero-data.
   Summary names the opener matchup. Falls back to franchise headliners
   (`getFranchiseHeadliners`, top projected per franchise) when the
   schedule feed is missing, then to the legacy randomHeroPlayer hero.

5. **UDFA window hero (7 days after the rookie draft)** —
   `src/components/theleague/UdfaCompositeHero.astro`: FOUR side-by-side
   team-gradient panels (matchup-card style) showing the best rookies still
   on the board — `castRookiesOnBoard` walks dynasty ADP for unrostered
   current-class rookies. Green band underneath carries the pitch +
   Browse-free-agents CTA. Two Brandon requirements (2026-07-05):
   - **Team logo ALWAYS a background watermark** on every panel
     (`.udh__logo`, opacity ~0.16 behind the player), not just a 404
     fallback. A slow/missing photo never leaves an empty flank.
   - **404'd headshots must not cost a player.** The page casts EIGHT
     rookies (`count: 8`); four render, four are hidden spares. A post-load
     `<script>` (`settle()` on each cutout, re-runs on `astro:page-load`)
     keeps the first four whose photo actually loads, swaps spares in for
     404s, and renumbers the shown panels 1-4. Deep UDFA rookies with no
     ESPN photo (e.g. J'Mari Taylor, Robert Henry) get replaced by the next
     rookies down whose photos load. If <4 ever load, it shows the first
     four anyway (logos carry them).
   Router requires ≥2 resolvable rookies, else legacy UDFAHero (whose
   `randomHeroPlayer` decoration survives only as that fallback).

## Future Directions (mocked, not built)

Breaking-story hero (48h window, high priority — playerIds plumbing already
done), cut-watch urgent hero (priciest cut candidate via `castRosterModel`),
tagged-showcase panels (per-tag team-gradient panels), split matchup card,
compact spotlight card. Mockups: scratchpad `hero-explorations.html` from the
2026-07-04 session. This work sits on the dark-mode branch
(claude/stoic-gauss-85d450 base).
