## 2026-01-18 - Team Icons Are Stored in Config Files

**Context:** Need to display team logos in nav footer

**Insight:** Team icons are defined in the league config files, not as separate asset lookups.

**Evidence:**
- TheLeague: `src/data/theleague.config.json` → `teams[franchiseId].icon`
- AFL: `data/afl-fantasy/afl.config.json` → `teams[franchiseId].icon`
- Path pattern: `/assets/theleague/icons/{team-name}.png`

**Recommendation:** Access team icons via config, not by constructing paths manually:
```typescript
const teamConfig = config.teams[franchiseId];
const iconUrl = teamConfig?.icon;
```

## 2026-01-18 - Existing Navigation Has Two Header Components

**Context:** Planning nav drawer redesign

**Insight:** The codebase has two separate header/nav systems:
1. `src/components/Header.astro` - Main site header with hamburger drawer
2. `src/components/theleague/Header.astro` - League-specific with breadcrumb + icon nav + drawer

Both slide from the right and share similar patterns but have different link structures.

**Evidence:**
- Main Header: 8 links across Tools/Leagues sections
- TheLeague Header: Desktop icon nav (6 icons) + mobile drawer with 4 sections (Tools, Advanced Reports, Community, Leagues)

**Recommendation:** The new unified nav component should replace both, using config to determine which links/sections to show based on context.

## 2026-01-18 - Dark Mode Should Be Supported Going Forward

**Context:** Nav redesign planning

**Insight:** All future work should support dark mode. Use CSS custom properties that adapt via `prefers-color-scheme` media query AND manual `.dark` class toggle.

**Evidence:** Design decision made during nav redesign planning session.

**Recommendation:** Pattern for dark mode support:
```css
:root {
  --component-bg: #ffffff;
  --component-text: #333333;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  :root {
    --component-bg: #1e293b;
    --component-text: #f1f5f9;
  }
}

/* Manual toggle support */
.dark {
  --component-bg: #1e293b;
  --component-text: #f1f5f9;
}
```

## 2026-02-12 - Franchise History System for Name/Logo Changes

**Context:** Heavy Chevy (franchise 0004) rebranded to Dead Cap Walking for the 2026 season. Need historical views (standings, playoffs, salary history) to show the old name/logo while current views show the new one.

**Insight:** Added a `history` array to team config entries in `theleague.config.json`. Each entry has `yearStart`/`yearEnd` plus all identity fields (name, nameMedium, nameShort, abbrev, aliases, icon, banner, groupMe). The `getTeamIdentityForYear()` function in `src/utils/team-names.ts` resolves the correct identity for any given year.

**Evidence:**
- Config: `src/data/theleague.config.json` → franchise 0004 has `history[]` with Heavy Chevy 2007-2025
- Utility: `src/utils/team-names.ts` → `getTeamIdentityForYear(team, year)`
- Tests: `tests/franchise-history.test.ts`
- MFL API: No dedicated history endpoint. Year-scoped `league` exports return names as they were that year.

**Recommendation:** For pages showing historical data, use `getTeamIdentityForYear()` to resolve team identity:
```typescript
import { getTeamIdentityForYear, type TeamConfig } from '../utils/team-names';

const identity = getTeamIdentityForYear(team as TeamConfig, year);
const displayName = chooseTeamName({
  fullName: identity.name,
  nameMedium: identity.nameMedium,
  nameShort: identity.nameShort,
  abbrev: identity.abbrev,
});
// identity.icon and identity.banner also resolve correctly
```
Future franchise rebrandings just need a new history entry added to the config.

## 2026-02-23 - Player Lockup Standard

**Context:** Multiple components displayed players with slightly different patterns — some missed DEF handling, some skipped `normalizeTeamCode()`, causing broken logos for KC, JAX, NE, NO.

**Insight:** A single "Player Lockup" pattern was established as a CLAUDE.md-level standard. All player displays must use `PlayerCell.astro` with proper DEF detection and team code normalization.

**Evidence:** FreeAgentNeedsCard.astro had broken Kansas City Chiefs logo (KCC.svg not found — file is KC.svg). DEF players showed generic silhouette instead of team logo.

**Recommendation:** Before building any new player list/card/table, check CLAUDE.md > Player Display for the required pattern. Use `normalizeTeamCode()` for ALL NFL logo URLs. Test with JAC, KCC, NEP, NOS teams.
