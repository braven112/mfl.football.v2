## Storage & bundle discipline (Aug 2026 perf overhaul)

Four invariants from the storage/perf work — breaking any of them quietly
regrows a 7 GB `.git` or a 30 MB server chunk:

- **MFL returns arrays in nondeterministic order, so never write a feed
  with a plain `writeFileSync` + byte diff.** All feed/data writers go
  through `writeJsonIfChanged` (`scripts/lib/canonical-json.mjs`): order-
  blind semantic compare (volatile keys like `fetchedAt`/`lastFetched`
  excluded), skip the write when nothing real changed. Files are NEVER
  re-sorted on disk (MFL standings row order is official). Before this,
  ~95% of all commits were byte-shuffles of identical data — that's how
  `.git` hit 7 GB on a 249 MB tree. Roster-sync runs `--refresh-live`,
  not `--force`: rosters/transactions/standings stay on the 5-minute
  cadence; players.json + the 17-call weeklyResults loop fetch once/day.
- **No all-years eager globs over megafiles.** `players.json` /
  `weekly-results-raw.json` globs must carry the current-era year filter
  (`20{2[5-9],[3-9][0-9]}`, floor-bump reminder built into
  `tests/current-era-feed-globs.test.ts`). Pages that genuinely render
  every season read a prebuild-derived snapshot instead — TheLeague
  rosters uses `data/theleague/derived/roster-season-payloads.json`
  (`compute-roster-season-payloads.mjs`; the payload builder is shared
  with the page via `scripts/lib/roster-season-payload.mjs`).
- **The schefter feeds are bounded, not append-forever.** Active window =
  `SCHEFTER_ACTIVE_MAX` (300) posts; a weekly workflow rotates the tail
  into `schefter-archive/<year>.json` beside each feed, and `mergeFeed`'s
  `archivedThroughTimestamp` watermark stops the 15-minute scans from
  resurrecting archived posts. Article permalinks and the OG renderer
  fall back to the archives — new single-post surfaces must too.
- **Retention rules live in `scripts/lib/retention-policy.mjs`** (What's
  New active cap + archive, roster-history keeper window / weekly
  keyframes). The July 16-31 roster snapshots are the official AFL keeper
  record: never prune them, and never skip writing them.

Per-page HTML caching (s-maxage) was evaluated and rejected: the layout
personalizes nav/footer from the session on every page, so shared caching
would leak one owner's nav to everyone. Requires client-side nav
personalization first.

`scripts/measure-baseline.mjs` prints the storage/churn health snapshot
(git sizes, commit rates, feed sizes, `--ttfb` for prod timings); baseline
from 2026-08-16 is committed under `data/perf-baseline/`.


## Astro 7 — strict Rust compiler, pinned compressHTML

Upgraded to Astro 7 (Vite 8/Rolldown, @astrojs/vercel 11) in July 2026.
Gotchas the new compiler enforces that the old Go compiler silently fixed:

- **No HTML comments directly inside template expressions** — `{cond && (
  <!-- x --> <div>...` is a hard CompilerError. Put the comment above the
  expression or inside the element/fragment.
- **Tags must balance exactly** (no auto-closing at EOF, no tolerating a
  mismatched closer). Errors surface one file per build; to see them all at
  once, run `@astrojs/compiler-rs#transform` over `src/**/*.astro` and
  collect `diagnostics` where `severity === 'error'`.
- `compressHTML: true` is pinned in `astro.config.ts` because v7's new
  default `'jsx'` strips whitespace between inline elements site-wide.
  Don't remove it without a visual audit.
- Known dead CSS (predates v7, now warned on by lightningcss at build):
  `:global()` inside `<style is:global>` blocks (both lineup pages +
  cr-list) ships literally and browsers drop those rules. Fixing it will
  *activate* previously-dead rules — do it deliberately, with screenshots.
- vitest 1.x + root `vite@^5` are intentionally separate from Astro's
  vite 8 (pnpm isolates them; vitest.config doesn't use astro/config).
