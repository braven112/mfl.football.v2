        is determined by the final standings from Week 13 of the previous season, with the Super Bowl winner
        automatically receiving the 12th pick. Any ties will be broken using the league’s official standings tiebreaker
        rules.</p>
    <p>During the NIT, teams can earn improved draft position. Points are awarded based on base draft position, ranging
        from 12 points for the worst record to 1 point for the conference champion. The top 5 NIT finishers receive an
        additional 1.5 points. The first round will be reordered by total points earned. In the event of a tie, the team
        with the higher original draft position will receive the higher pick.</p>

    <h2 id="replacement-owners">Replacement Owners</h2>
    <p>Owners are expected to submit lineups weekly. If an owner fails to do so for <strong>two consecutive
                weeks</strong> or <strong>three times in a season</strong>, they will be asked to surrender the
            franchise.</p>
    <p>If a team leaves the league, a new owner will be selected and will take over the team as-is, including rosters,
        keepers, draft picks, and any financial obligations. No refunds will be issued to any departing owner.</p>
    <p>The Commissioner maintains a waiting list and will use it to identify suitable replacement owners. Owners may not
        sell or transfer ownership of their teams without prior approval from the Commissioner. If an owner voluntarily
        exits, the team becomes property of the league until reassigned.</p>
    <p>In the event that two or more members leave the league simultaneously, a dispersal draft will be conducted. All
        players and draft picks from the vacated teams will be combined into a pool, from which the new owners will
        draft to build their rosters.</p>

    <h2 id="rule-changes">Rule Changes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Any vote taken by the league to change the rules requires a <strong>75%</strong> vote to pass (<strong>18
                out of 24</strong> owners).</li>
        <li>Votes taken between <strong>July 15th</strong> and <strong>Week 17</strong> require a <strong>100%</strong>
            vote to take effect immediately.</li>
        <li>If such a vote receives 75% or more but less than 100%, it will take effect the following season.</li>
        <li>Rule change votes should ideally occur between the <strong>trade deadline</strong> and the end of
            <strong>Week 17</strong>.</li>
        <li><strong>Abstentions</strong> will be considered <strong>"Yes"</strong> votes.</li>
        <li>All poll votes are <strong>final after 5 days</strong> from when they begin.</li>
        <li>Any unforeseen rule situation not specifically covered in the constitution will be resolved by the
            <strong>Commissioner</strong>.</li>
