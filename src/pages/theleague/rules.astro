      <h2 id="division-setup">Division Set up</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The League consist of 4 divisions of four teams each: Pacific, Midwest, Central and Atlantic.</li>
        <li>Each team within the division will play twice during the regular season.</li>
        <li>
          Divisional winners receive an automatic playoff birth.<br>
          <br>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="team-rosters">Team Rosters</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each team can have up to 22 players on their active roster, plus an additional 3 practice squad (taxi squad)
          spots.</li>
        <li>During the offseason (from the conclusion of Week 17 until the 3rd Sunday in August at 8:45pm PT), there is
          no limit on the number of players on a team's active roster.</li>
        <li>Teams must have at least 20 players under contract from the first game of the season until the last game of
          the year (Week 17).</li>
        <li>Rosters can include any combination of the following positions: QB, RB, WR, TE, PK, DEF.</li>
        <li>RotoWire is the official depth chart of the league. If RotoWire lists a player's position differently than
          MFL, the commissioner will adjust the position as desired by the owner before the upcoming week's kickoff.
        </li>
        <li>Teams can place up to 3 rookies on the Practice Squad at a rate of 50% of their base salary against the cap.
        </li>
        <li>Only rookies are eligible for the practice squad. Any player considered a rookie by <b>MFL</b> will be
          eligible for the practice squad. (The NFL defines a rookie as any player without an accrued NFL season.)
        </li>
        <li>During the offseason (as defined on the league calendar), teams may have fewer than 20 players on their
          roster.</li>
        <li>All teams must have 20 players under contract by the end of the Off-Season Free Agency Period.</li>
        <li>At the start of each season, all players who were on the IR or Practice Squad at the end of the previous
          year must be moved to the active roster. Teams have until February 15th to comply with this requirement.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="injured-reserve">Injured Reserve</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Each franchise can have an unlimited number of IR spots.</li>
        <li>IR players' salaries count 100% against the cap.</li>
        <li>Only players on the official IR list are eligible, with no exceptions.</li>
        <li>IR players can only be activated if they are removed from the MFL's IR list.</li>
        <li>IR players can be traded or released.</li>

        <li>Def: 1</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Lineup Submission</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Lineups are due at "game time" of the player involved.</li>
        <li>Teams that fail to submit a starting lineup, the previous week's lineup will be used.</li>
        <li>Teams must submit a valid lineup each week. A valid lineup consists of no players on a bye or listed as out
          on the NFL injury report, if another option exists on your bench.</li>
        <li>Teams that fail to submit a valid lineup for two consecutive weeks will be considered abandoned.</li>

      <ul>
        <li>Franchises have a $45 million salary cap that cannot be exceeded.</li>
        <li>Contracts are between 1-5 years and cannot be traded.</li>
        <li>Contracts transfer with the player if traded.</li>
        <li>Players without a contract cannot be traded.</li>
        <li>Rookies are assigned a 5-year contract unless adjusted before the third Sunday in August.</li>
        <li>Teams must have enough cap space for drafted rookies. If not, the player must be signed and then released
          with a 50% cap hit (based on a one-year contract).</li>
        <li>Free agents receive a default 1-year contract. Longer contracts must be submitted within:
          <ul>
            <li>24 hours during the season</li>
            <li>48 hours in the offseason</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Contracts expire on February 15th, reducing by one year. Players with zero years become free agents unless
          tagged.</li>
        <li>Contracts cannot be renegotiated. However, if a player is released and re-signed through free agency, a new
          contract length may be assigned.</li>
      </ul>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Message Board:</strong> Place all tags and bids on the league message board.</li>
        <li><strong>Tagging Period:</strong> February 1 – February 14 8:45pm PT.</li>
        <li><strong>Bidding Period:</strong> February 15 – February 28 8:45pm PT (or 29th on leap years).</li>
        <li><strong>Matching Period:</strong> The original team has until March 7th to match the highest offer.</li>

      </ul>
      <blockquote class="fine-print">
        <strong>Tag Compensation:</strong> The compensation for losing a tagged player will be the original draft picks
        from the bidder. If the original picks are not owned, the highest available picks in the bidder's inventory at
        the start of the tagging period (Feb 1st 12:00am PT) will be used. When placing the bid, the bidder must state
        the draft
        picks given up, and those picks become protected and non-tradeable until after the tag matching deadline has
        passed.<br><br>
        If the bidder does not have the required round pick, then the next highest pick in their inventory above the
        required round will be used (e.g., a 1st round pick if a 2nd round pick is required).
        <br><br>
        <strong>Compensatory draft picks:</strong> 1.17, 2.17,2.18 can be used as compensation, but are considered one
        round lower. (i.e, 1.17 can be used in place of a 2nd round pick.)

              (original pick), 2.13 and bids on two Franchise Players.</li>
            <li>First bid: Uses <strong>original 1st and 2nd round pick</strong>.</li>
            <li>Second bid: Uses <strong>highest remaining 1st and 2nd round pick</strong> from their inventory.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Franchise Tag Example 2:</strong>

            <li>Team Hotel places a Franchise Tag <strong>bid</strong> on Team India's Player D at 12:00pm.</li>
            <li>Team Hotel places a Franchise Tag <strong>bid</strong> on Team Juliet's Player E at 12:05pm.</li>
            <li>Team Hotel must state they are using <strong>this year's original 1st and 2nd round pick</strong> as

      <h2 id="veteran-extensions">Veteran Extensions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>From now until <strong>February 15, 2028</strong>, each team may extend <strong>one veteran player per
            season</strong>.</li>
        <li>The total contract length after extension may not exceed <strong>6 years</strong>.</li>
        <li>Extension values will follow the same formula used in <strong>Rookie Extensions</strong> (see Rookie
          Extensions section).</li>
        <li>Only <strong>one player per team per season</strong> may be extended under this rule.</li>
        <li><strong>Rookies on 4-year contracts</strong> are not eligible for this type of extension.</li>
        <li>To be eligible, a player must have at least <strong>2 years remaining</strong> on their contract at the time
          of extension.</li>
        <li>This rule applies to <strong>all players equally</strong>. A separate vote will determine how it applies to
          players from the current year's rookie draft.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 id="rookie-extensions">Rookie Extensions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Rookie Extensions allow teams to add <strong>2 additional years</strong> to a rookie contract.</li>
        <li><strong>Eligibility:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Only rookie contracts that you originally drafted are eligible.</li>
            <li>Players acquired via trade may also be extended, <strong>but only if the extension is applied by
                February 14 at 8:45pm PT in the same league year</strong> they were acquired.</li>
            <li>Extensions may be applied as early as Year 1, but no later than the start of Year 4.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Contract Terms:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>The extension adds two years to the existing contract.</li>
            <li>Extension salary = average of the top 5 salaries at the player's position.</li>
            <li>This average is multiplied by 2 (for two years), then divided by the number of remaining years on
              the contract plus 2.</li>
            <li>The result is added to the player's existing annual salary, and that new total increases by
              <strong>10% per year</strong>.</li>

        <li><strong>Salary Formula Example:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Player has 2 years remaining on their contract.</li>
            <li>Top 5 positional salary average = $8,500,000</li>
            <li>Extension value = $8.5M × 2 = $17,000,000</li>
            <li>Total contract years (2 remaining + 2 extension) = 4</li>
            <li>17,000,000 ÷ 4 = $4,250,000</li>
            <li>This amount is added to each year, then increased annually by 10%:

          the
          team will remain (thus no refunds to any owner leaving early). The Commish maintains a waiting list and will
          use this to find replacement owners. An owner may not sell
          or
          otherwise change the ownership of his/her team without Commish approval. If an owner wishes to leave, the
          team becomes property of the league and the Commish will find
